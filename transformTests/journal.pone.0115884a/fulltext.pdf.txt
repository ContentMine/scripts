A New Tadpole-Bearing Frog
an unusual ovoviviparous reproductive strategy. Here we describe that species,
and provide additional details on its reproductive mode.
Anurans exhibit tremendous diversity in mode of reproduction. Not only have
there been many independent origins of direct development, the condition in
which a free-living tadpole stage is bypassed and froglets emerge from the egg
capsules [5], but a bewildering array of mechanisms has evolved wherein parents
care for their developing offspring. Examples of parental care include guarding of
terrestrial eggs, transport of tadpoles on the back following hatching, carrying
developing eggs in pouches or depressions on the back and flanks, males carrying
developing tadpoles in the vocal sac, and even the now-extinct species of gastric
brooding frogs in which the female carried her developing tadpoles in her
stomach (see [6] for a summary). Despite this extreme reproductive diversity,
internal fertilization has evolved only a few times among the 6455 known species
of anurans [7, 8]. Only the African bufonid genera Nectophrynoides and
Nimbaphrynoides and the now extinct Puerto Rican species, Eleutherodactylus
jasperi, are documented to combine internal fertilization with egg retention and
subsequent birth of froglets [9]. To this group, we can now add a species of
Sulawesi fanged frog in the genus Limnonectes with internal fertilization and live
birth of tadpoles, a reproductive mode that is unique among anurans.
Materials and Methods
We analyzed more than 100 specimens representing the new species from 23
localities on the island of Sulawesi. This study was conducted under an approved
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol issued to JAM by the
University of California at Berkeley (Protocol #R279). Fieldwork conducted in
Indonesia was undertaken under research permits issued by LIPI and RISTEK,
with specimen exportation authorized under permits or loans issued by LIPI, the
Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense, and Pusat Studi Biologi. Specimens were
captured by hand in the field, sacrificed via emersion in an aqueous solution of
MS-222 (tricaine methane sulfonate) buffered to neutral pH, and prepared as
formalin-fixed specimens deposited primarily in the Museum Zoologicum
Bogoriense (the national museum of Indonesia) or Museum of Vertebrate
Zoology at UC Berkeley. As part of a comprehensive study of Sulawesi
Limnonectes diversification, we obtained morphometric data for the full Sulawesi
assemblage. Sex was determined by inspection of gonads. The following
measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 mm using digital calipers: snout-vent
length (SVL) – from cloaca to tip of snout; head width (HW) – widest distance
between posterior end of lower jaw; head length (HL) – from posterior end of
lower jaw to tip of snout; femur length (FE) – from cloaca to distal end of femur;
tibia length (TI) – from knee to distal end of tibia; foot length (FL) – from distal
end of tibia-fibula to tip of 4th toe; inner metatarsal tubercle (IM); humerus
length (UA) – from proximal end of upper arm to elbow; lower arm length (LA) –
from elbow joint to base of middle palmar tubercle; hand length (HA) – from

Taxonomy
Limnonectes larvaepartus new species (Figs. 1, 2)
Urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act: 60AA7136-89A0-4DBB-9FBC-BD0FAF8A214C
This species has been referred to in the literature under the names Limnonectes
larviparus [11] and Limnonectes ‘‘ovovivipar’’ [4], both of which created nomina
nuda. This species also corresponds to Limnonectes sp. V in [2, 3].
Etymology
The species name larvaepartus (from ‘larvae’, plural of larva, the early form of an
animal, and ‘partus’, to give birth to) reflects the unique reproductive mode of
this tadpole-bearing species.

Distribution
Limnonectes larvaepartus occurs across the Northern Peninsula, as well as on the
western margin of Sulawesi’s Central Core (Fig. 3). We do not know the full
extent of the species’ range in the Central Core because the central highlands of
Sulawesi remain poorly explored herpetologically. Several genera have species
range boundaries in this same general region (e.g. the flying lizards Draco
spilonotus and D. walker [12], the fanged frogs Limnonectes sp. I and L. sp. D [3],
and the tarsiers Tarsius lariang and T. dentatus [13].
Diagnosis
Prior workers have recognized substantial species diversity in the genus
Limnonectes on Sulawesi. However, diagnosing many of these lineages on the basis
of morphology is challenging, and several authors have instead opted to apply
names to Sulawesi specimens representing species from outside Sulawesi.
Consequently, the following names have all been incorrectly applied to Sulawesi
populations: the Lesser Sundas species (type locality: Flores Island) L.
dammermani (Mertens, 1927), the Bornean species L. finchii (Inger, 1966), the
Mollucan species (type locality: Ambon) L. grunniens (Daudin, 1801), and the
Philippine taxa L. leytensis (Boettger, 1893), L. magnus (Stejneger, 1909), and L.
palavanensis (Boulenger, 1894). These names should not be applied to Sulawesi
populations, as was verified phylogenetically for several of these taxa [3]. Only
four Sulawesi species have been described: L. arathooni (Smith, 1927), L. heinrichi
(Ahl, 1933), L. modestus (Boulenger, 1882), and L. microtympanum (van Kampen,
1909). However, we will show elsewhere that L. heinrichi is a junior synonym of L.
modestus and the species complex that we have referred to previously [2, 3] as L.
modestus remains undescribed – thus, at present there are but three valid
described species of Sulawesi Limnonectes.
Limnonectes larvaepartus can be distinguished from all other described species
of Limnonectes by its reproductive mode (Fig. 2). It can be further differentiated
from all described Sulawesi species by its combination of body size (mean male
SVL537.4; female SVL540.2 mm), coloration, tympanum size, and degree of
hind foot webbing, as well as on the basis of phylogenetic placement (Fig. 3).
Limnonectes arathooni is endemic to Sulawesi’s Southwestern (SW) Peninsula
south of the Tempe Depression, and thus does not occur within the range of L.
larvaepartus. It is similar in size to the new species (male SVL536.6 mm,
females539.6 mm), but differs in having substantially reduced webbing
(extending to penultimate phalange of fourth toe vs. to toe disc), in lacking fine
granular dorsal tubercles, and in having melanic spots above the forelimb
insertion, a fine ridge extending posteriorly behind each eye, and an alternative

derived reproductive mode in which males guard clutches of terrestrial eggs that
hatch into tadpoles that then make their own way to an adjacent stream by sliding
down steep stream-side embankments [14]. Limnonectes microtympanum, like L.
arathooni, is restricted to the SW Peninsula south of the Tempe Depression, and
thus does not overlap in geographical range with L. larvaepartus. Limnonectes
microtympanum is moderately large (male SVL578.4; female SVL572.4 mm),
and thus much larger than the new species. Limnonectes microtympanum also
differs from the new species in having proportionally smaller tympana (TY/
SVL50.05+0.01 in males, 0.06+0.01 in females versus 0.08+0.01 in both sexes in L.
larvaepartus). The new species occurs in broad sympatry with L. modestus, which
is a moderate sized (male SVL570.2 mm; female SVL564.0 mm) inhabitant of
fast-moving streams and substantially larger than L. larvaepartus. Like L.
larvaepartus, L. modestus has nearly complete hindfoot webbing (slightly more
extensive in L. modestus than in L. larvaepartus but reaching the toe disc in both
species), a dusky throat with melanic pigments extending onto the pectoral region
(in a clear wedge shape in L. modestus, more randomly distributed in L.

larvaepartus), and skin with extensive fine granular tubercles. Limnonectes
modestus also exhibits a derived reproductive mode involving production of a
relatively small number of large (10 mm diameter) eggs that are deposited along
the edge of fast moving streams.
Description of the holotype
An adult male (Fig. 1) 48 mm SVL, body moderately robust, head not broader
than body, head about 65% longer than wide, length 45% of snout-vent length,
snout 17% of snout-vent length, moderately pointed, projecting above lower jaw,
nostril lateral, closer to tip of snout than to eye, lore essentially straight, canthus
rostralis distinct, eye about equal to snout length, pupil diamond-shaped, upper
eyelid with tubercles; interorbital region smooth, width 69% of internarial
distance, tympanum moderate, slightly wider than interorbital distance,
supratympanic fold distinct, extending from posterior corner of eye to supra-
axillary region, in contact with tympanic annulus, temporal muscle slightly
enlarged; odontoid process 2.1 mm. Dentigerous process of vomer distinct,
angled anterolaterally, approximately at 45o angle, posterior ends separated by
distance approximately equal to one-third diameter of choanae. Limbs relatively
slender, tibia width at thickest part 7.5 mm; femur length 52% of snout-vent
length, heels moderately overlapping when placed perpendicular to body axis;
tibia length 64.9% of foot length, 48.9% of snout-vent length; foot length 71% of
snout-vent length; tarsal fold indistinct, only evident as a ridge; toe discs
moderately expanded, circum-marginal groove horseshoe-shaped, pointed
anteriorly. Plantar surface of foot smooth, subarticular tubercle rounded, relative
length of toes 4.3.5.2.1. Inner metatarsal tubercle prominent, elongate,
ovoid with a sharp spade like ventral edge; outer metatarsal tubercle absent; hind
foot webbing full, extending to toe discs, slightly emarginated. Manus length
51.3% of foot length, fingers slender, terminal discs slightly expanded, length
formula 3.1$4$2, with slight differences in length, subarticular tubercle
rounded, convex; supernumerary tubercles absent; inner and outer metacarpal
tubercles enlarged, nuptial pads and webbing absent, forearm muscle not
enlarged. See Table 1 for measurements and variation.
Coloration
The dorsal coloration is highly variable, typically brownish-grey, but can be darker
brown on the dorsolateral region, and some individuals are reddish-brown or
golden-tan (see Fig. 2). ,23% of specimens have a bold mid-dorsal stripe. The
venter is either yellowish or cream colored, with the upper end of the tibia usually
bearing a prominent dark spot. A light bar is often present in the interorbital
region, and the coloration of the snout to interorbital region may be lighter than
the remainder of the dorsum. The tympanum is often masked in black leaving
only the lower rim sharing the predominant body coloration. The gular region is
usually darker in males and may have a finely mottled wedge-shaped melanic

observed is 55, which possibly represents the contents of just one oviduct. The
eggs lack a jelly-coat and reach at least ,3 mm in diameter. These eggs develop
within the oviducts into pigmented tadpoles that reach at least Gosner stage 35
prior to parturition (see [16] for staging). The gut is initially provisioned with
substantial yolk (Fig. 2b), and developing tadpoles prematurely removed from the
oviducts at approximately stage 21 progressed to approximately stage 25 over the
course of two weeks in a water bottle without supplemental food, suggesting
plasticity in terms of the timing of parturition. A detailed description of the
tadpole is provided in the accompanying paper by Kusrini et al. [15].
Natural history
Limnonectes larvaepartus occurs in natural and disturbed forest habitats of
Sulawesi, generally in sympatry with at least one, and sometimes as many as five
other Limnonectes species. In the western Central Core of Sulawesi, we have always
found L. larvaepartus living in sympatry with a much larger species that has been
referred to in the literature as L. sp. D (2,3). Whereas L. sp. D is generally found
on rocks in fast-moving streams or within a meter of water on the banks of fast-
flowing streams, L. larvaepartus is usually found further from the stream (2–10
meters from water) on rocky substrates, in leaf-litter, or secluded in grassy
vegetation. Because we have observed that L. sp. D predates other frogs, including
other Limonectes, it is possible that L. larvaepartus avoids large streams in response
to predation pressure from larger Limnonectes species. Male L. larvaepartus
typically call from the margins of seeps, puddles, or small pools away from the
main stream. Notably, we have found many males calling from small pools that
were already inhabited by L. larvaepartus tadpoles (Fig. 2c), with as many as three
size-classes of tadpoles represented. It is unclear whether some or all of the
observed tadpoles were sired by the accompanying male. We have furthermore
collected at least one pregnant female from a small stream-side puddle already
inhabited by tadpoles of two size classes, again suggesting the possibility that
individual pools may be visited repeatedly by the same adult males and females
during the reproductive season.
Discussion
We first became aware of the unusual reproductive mode of Limnonectes
larvaepartus while conducting fieldwork on Sulawesi. In several instances, we
discovered tadpoles in the oviducts while preparing specimens. In each case,

A New Tadpole-Bearing Frog
having sacrificed frogs for preparation, the abdominal wall was observed to
quiver, and incision resulted in living tadpoles emerging from the opening (see S1
Movie). On one occasion, a gravid female gave birth to tadpoles in-hand at the
moment of capture. On four other occasions, field-collected L. larvaepartus in our
possession gave birth to tadpoles while being held individually in collecting bags.
In total, we have either observed tadpoles in the oviducts or direct-birth of
tadpoles on 19 occasions.
Because we have not witnessed natural birth of tadpoles in free-living frogs, two
possible alternative reproductive modes are possible for this species. Limnonectes
larvaepartus reproduction may simply reflect what we have observed in the hand –
direct birth of tadpoles. Alternatively, this species may be capable of retaining
developing young in the oviducts through metamorphosis with subsequent birth
of froglets, as is the case for Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the African
bufonid genera Nectophrynoides and Nimbaphrynoides [9, 17, 18]. The latter mode
seems unlikely for several reasons. First, we have collected 19 pregnant individuals
carrying tadpoles in the oviducts but none carrying froglets. These 19 females were
collected across different months, years, and localities. Second, we have observed
and collected at least four clutches of free-living L. larvaepartus tadpoles in small
pools of water on the margins of streams, with each of these samples exhibiting
two or three size classes and thus possibly representing multiple clutches. Three of
these clutches were accompanied by males, some of which were calling, and one
was found in association with the gravid female that gave birth to 55 tadpoles
(some in the hand of JAM, others subsequently deposited in a collecting bag).
Finally, although adaptive plasticity has been demonstrated for many frog species,
whereby tadpoles or froglets are capable of hatching from their eggs prematurely
when attacked by predators [19], this has only been documented for a single
direct-developer, Eleutherodactylus coqui [20]. In the case of E. coqui, the capacity
for early hatching commenced at stages 13 or 14, whereas normal hatching
occurred at stage 15 (see [21] for staging). Thus, E. coqui were capable of
premature hatching only as froglets, with toe pads and eyelids present but before
the tail was completely resorbed, a stage much later than would be required by L.
larvaepartus if it were simultaneously capable of hatching as either a tadpole or
full-term froglet. Most direct-developers, as well as the few frog species that give
birth to froglets, pass through the tadpole stage in a form poorly suited for free-
living. In many such species, the tadpole has a broad, highly vascularized
‘respiratory tail’ specialized for intra-egg or intra-oviductal gas exchange rather
than for swimming, as is the case for Eleutherodactylus jasperi [17], and may lack
mouthparts and functional gills [22, 23, 24]. In others, the tail remains
rudimentary and limb buds appear early in development such that a typical
tadpole phenotype never occurs [22, 23]. Given these observations, it appears
unlikely that any one species would be characterized by the combination of (1)
internal fertilization, (2) complete metamorphosis within the oviducts and live-
birth in the form of froglets, as well as (3) an oviductal tadpole stage that is
capable of premature birth and free-living. Although we think that L. larvaepartus
is much more likely to give birth to tadpoles as its sole mode of reproduction as

A New Tadpole-Bearing Frog
opposed to exhibiting adaptive plasticity allowing for birth of either tadpoles or
froglets depending on the circumstances confronting the frog, we note that either
condition would be unique among Anura. In either case, L. larvaepartus requires
internal fertilization, which is, itself, extremely rare among anurans [8, 25]. The
mechanism by which internal fertilization takes place is unknown, and there is no
obvious intromittent organ present to facilitate sperm transfer. If L. larvaepartus
reproduction always involves birth of tadpoles, it is likely that they are
ovoviparous given that the tadpoles are well provisioned with yolk and appear
fully capable of developing without nutrient transfer from the mother. Prior to
parturition, the tadpoles have well-developed tails and pigmentation, and well
developed mouthparts. Given this morphology, it is unlikely that these tadpoles
are endotrophic (never feed before metamorphosing into froglets). It is more
likely that the tadpoles are born after exhausting their yolk supply, and are
subsequently self-feeding prior to metamorphosis. Nevertheless, it is clear that
much remains to be learned about this unusual frog, the discovery of which brings
to light yet another axis of diversity characterizing the remarkable Sulawesi fanged
frog adaptive radiation.
